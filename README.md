# RickAndMorty
A rick and morty wiki app


There's some improvements that can be done.
A lot of testing needs to be improved (will be working on it on the next few days).
A location filter screen should be added.
A list of episodes with info about them would be a nice section to have.
Probably will be commiting some of these changes soon.

Maybe make some protocols for the repositories to avoid having so much duplicated code, maybe using some generics for the results?
Reuse code for the views since they are basically doing the same thing. Review how the view protocol can be implemented in such way all the list views can be implemented just once, also maybe using generics?
Will need some way to create and show each of the different models if everything is changed by generics.
